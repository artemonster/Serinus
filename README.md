This is a test repository of the engine and synthesizer for my upcoming audio hardware box.<br>
You may find interesting looking up following files: <br>
* Engine.h/.cpp <br>
* PatchModule.h/.cpp <br>

(!) Do note, that this is a test repo, meaning that most of the time it won't even work (and/or compile with warnings). <br>
Moreover, the project source directory is flat-structured and is a mess. To make it readable and undestandable you may want to load the solution to see grouping.
